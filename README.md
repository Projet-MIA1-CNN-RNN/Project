# Projet
Repository of our implementation of PixelCNN for binarized MNIST

You will also find your full report about the two articles we studied.

If you want to launch our application with streamlit, please run the file "application.py". This application allow you to train your own PixelCNN network with multiple 
choices for parameters.

You can then train it and use it to generate new images based on binarized MNIST.
You can also use a pretrained model if you don't have time to train your own model.
